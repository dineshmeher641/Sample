        My native place is Belpahar. It is a small suburban town 
        in the district of Jharsuguda in Odisha. We have a paternal house 
        there. I live in it with my parents and my sister. I was born in 
        1997. In my seven year's life I had no occasion to go out of our 
        town. My school, my friends and some of our class relations are 
        all here.</p>
        <p> My grandfather was a famous physician in the locality. So our 
        family is known to many of the old residents of the town. Our 
        family is invariably invited on all important social functions. 
        There is a market, a cinema hall, a large playground and a railway station.
        There are buses, auto-rickshaws, taxis, etc. for transport. There is also a charitable dispensary which is run
        by the municipality. The road condition and sanitary system are quite good.
        In the market, one can get all sorts of consumer goods including clothes, shoes, stationery goods, etc. on
        various shops and stalls. The cinema hall shows good films, whether they are in Hindi, English or in regional
        languages. In the playground, football and cricket matches are frequently held between the local teams. We live
        happily in our native place which is our dear universe.
